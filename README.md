# BlockMatching
CPU and eventually a CUDA implementation of a Full Exhaustive Block Matching Algorithm using Integral Images for fast disparity calculation and standard deviation for automatically masking image regions from search. 

A personal endeavor to extend and practice work never implemented in [UOL-FinalYearProject](https://github.com/RaymondKirk/UOL-FinalYearProject), which was a final year project at the University of Lincoln ([Link](https://github.com/RaymondKirk/UOL-FinalYearProject/blob/master/uol-finalyearthesis.pdf))
